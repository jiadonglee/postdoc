There is obvious opportunity for me to bring my hardware, software, and physics expertise to the Stanford group, led by Assistant Professor Lauren Tompkins. In particular, there is a clear overlap in hardware interests as my work on gFEX, for the Level-1 Calorimeter Trigger System is the first line of defense before the High-Level Trigger System kicks in, which the Fast TracKer (FTK) is a part of. My experience with trigger and data acquisition is broad, from running trigger shifts in the ATLAS Control Room, to designing and implementing a Level-1 Trigger subsystem, and developing the slow-control and monitoring infrastructure that interfaces with the existing ATLAS systems. I am also very excited about collaborating with other members of the Stanford group on physics analyses including: applying machine learning, exploring pileup mitigation techniques, searches in boosted topologies, studying jet substructure, and understanding forward pileup jets in a high-luminosity environment. I would be happy to do a new kind of physics search such as Higgs or Exotics and I am confident I can quickly get up to speed. I am enthusiastic, I love to collaborate, and a post-doc position at Stanford is an excellent match for my current research interests.
