I am a particle physicist that thrives in a highly collaborative environment. My work on searching for supersymmetry with the ATLAS detector pioneered the use of boosted object reconstruction techniques to extend the results from the Run 1 program. Jets, especially those with significant substructure, accidental or otherwise, remains a significant focus of my work. I also have a strong background in instrumentation with gFEX that will allow me to directly contribute to the maintenance, operation, upgrade, and commissioning of the detector at CERN in order to maintain a physics program for the next generation of physicists. Since, LHC will be undergoing a long shutdown period at the end of 2018 until 2020, this provides ample opportunity to reach out to different hardware/instrumentation projects in ATLAS (particularly those focused on upgrade work) and participate in physics analyses that are uncovered within ATLAS in searching for physics beyond the SM. I hope to be able to continue being involved in trying to answer some open questions about the SM with your research group as well as provide expert hardware support for HL-LHC upgrades.
