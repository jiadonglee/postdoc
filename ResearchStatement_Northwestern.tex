There is obvious opportunity for me to bring my hardware, software, and physics expertise from working on the ATLAS experiment to the Northwestern group. In particular, there is a clear overlap in hardware interests as my work on the trigger instrumentation upgrade, which uses information from the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, gives me a unique skill that matches with the high granularity calorimeter upgrade for CMS in HL-LHC. My experience with trigger and data acquisition is also broad, from running trigger shifts in the ATLAS Control Room to designing and implementing slow-control and monitoring infrastructure for the trigger upgrade project I am involved in. I am also very excited about collaborating with other members of the Northwestern CMS group on physics analyses including Dark Matter searches, studying the physics of W/Z bosons, and potentially doing searches for new physics in the electroweak sector. I also think it would be very interesting to study pileup jets in the forward region using the geometry of the high granularity calorimeter and continue to push the limits of searches over the next 5 years as the LHC will not produce significantly more new data to analyze. While I do only have experience in searches for supersymmetry using boosted object recnostruction in hadronic final states, I am enthusiastic about learning and I am confident I can quickly get up to speed on a new analysis. I love to collaborate and a post-doc position at Northwestern is an excellent match for my current research interests.
